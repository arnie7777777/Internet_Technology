Collaboration:
We collaborated on the project together.
We consulted the following resources:
Python Socket Programming Tutorial
Google Python Style Guide
Python Socket Programming - Server, Client Example

Problems Faced:
We faced some issues with setting up the server and client to communicate with each other.
We spent approximately 5 hours on this project.
Usage

To run the server, use the following command:
python Server.py PORT

where PORT is the port number to listen on.
To run the client, use the following command:
python Client.py SERVERADDRESS PORT

where SERVERADDRESS is the domain name or IP address of the server and PORT is the port number to connect to.
By default, the client reads from a file called source_strings.txt and writes to a file called results.txt.
